### PyBird

It's another project I've made for HackClub's arcade event. It's a Discord bot which will shorten your links with bit.ly in just one, simple command!.

## Installation

What you will need:
- A Discord bot token - create your bot here [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications?new_application=true)
- A bit.ly API key - get yours [right there](https://app.bitly.com/settings/api/)
- The ID of the Discord server you would like the bot to run at!

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/A-Potion/shortbot.git
  cd shortbot
  pip install discord.py
  pip install validators
  pip install dotenv
  python main.py
```

And then answer the questions in the command line!
